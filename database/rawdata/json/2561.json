Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Maysaran Arsheen Pinot Gris. It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 18 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":476600,"title":"Maysara Arsheen Pinot Gris","description":"A bright expression of fruit right up front, greeting your palate with notes of cut grass on a warm day.

pork.","price":"$17.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/476600-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.9,"ratingCount":7,"score":0.8545454545454546,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fmaysara-arsheen-pinot-gris-2018%2F556900"}]},"instructions":null,"analyzedInstructions":[],"sourceName":null,"creditsText":null,"originalId":null},{"vegetarian":false,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":false,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":24,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"aggregateLikes":1,"spoonacularScore":81,"healthScore":51,"creditsText":"Coconut

In a 10- to 12-inch frying pan over medium-high heat, stir star anise or anise seeds, cumin, and coriander until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour spices into a blender and whirl until finely ground, or pour into a mortar and grind with a pestle.                                                                                                 Add coconut milk to frying pan; stir often over medium-high heat until milk is bubbly and fat begins to separate, 2 to 6 minutes (reduce heat if milk splatters out of pan). Add all the curry paste and stir until aromatic, 2 to 3 minutes. Add 1 1/4 cups broth, ground spices, whole basil leaves, fish sauce, and sugar. Rinse kaffir lime leaves, tear each in half, and stir into sauce; set aside.

Bake in a 400 regular or convection oven until fish is barely opaque but still moist-looking in center of thickest part (cut to test), 10 to 15 minutes for halibut, 8 to 10 minutes for catfish.
